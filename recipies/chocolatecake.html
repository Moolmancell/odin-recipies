    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150ml sunflower oil, plus extra for the tin</li>
        <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>150g caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp golden syrup</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>150ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the icing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>225g icing sugar</li>
        <li>40g cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2Â½ tbsp milk (a little more if needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
    <p>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base of two 18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.</p>
    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
    <p>Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs, sunflower oil and milk. Beat well with an electric whisk until smooth.</p>
    <h3>STEP 3</h3>
    <p>Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool for 10 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack.</p>
    <h3>STEP 4</h3>
    <p>To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft. Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then add enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.</p>
    <h3>STEP 5</h3>
    <p>Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more icing.</p>
