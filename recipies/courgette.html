    <p><em>Ditch the potatoes and try these moreish courgette fries as a snack or side dish. Scatter with parmesan before serving.</em></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>2 courgettes, cut into 1cm batons</li>
        <li>oil, for deep frying</li>
        <li>15g parmesan, grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
    <p>Tip the flour into a bowl, drizzle in 2 tbsp water and mix to form a thick batter. Season with plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper, then mix in the courgettes.</p>
    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
    <p>Pour oil into a pan until it is about 4cm deep, ensuring the pan is no more than two thirds full. Set over a medium heat until 180C or a flick of batter dropped in sizzles and turns brown within 30 seconds. Lower half the battered courgettes into the hot oil and fry, turning after 1 min using a slotted spoon, for 5-6 mins until golden. If they begin to stick together, gently coax them apart with tongs. Remove from the hot oil and drain on a plate lined with a sheet of kitchen paper. Repeat with the remaining half, then scatter with the parmesan before serving.</p>
